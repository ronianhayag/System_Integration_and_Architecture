    In studying System Integration and Architecture, I expect to gain a solid understanding of how complex systems are designed, structured, and linked together to function as a unified whole. I hope to explore the key principles that govern system design, such as scalability, modularity, interoperability, and efficiency. I also want to learn how these principles are applied in real-world situations. I am eager to understand how different hardware and software components from various platforms or technologies can communicate effectively and work together without conflict.

    I also look forward to recognizing and applying different methods and frameworks involved in creating a system engineering plan. This includes studying the life cycle of system development, learning about design patterns, and examining how integration strategies can be tailored to meet specific requirements. More importantly, I expect to gain hands-on experience with the actual tools, platforms, and technologies that professionals use to integrate systems. This exposure will help me connect theory with practice, giving me the skills needed to design and implement integration solutions.

    Lastly, I believe this subject will significantly improve my problem-solving and decision-making skills, which are essential when working with modern systems that are increasingly interconnected and complex. Overall, I see this subject as an opportunity to deepen my knowledge, sharpen my technical skills, and prepare myself to contribute effectively to the design, management, and evolution of modern integrated systems in the professional world.
